# Bandit Level 6 → Level 7

## Objective

Retrieve the password stored somewhere on the system with the following properties:

- Owned by user `bandit7`
- Owned by group `bandit6`
- Exactly 33 bytes in size

---

## Problem

Unlike previous levels, the file was not located in a known directory.  
The search scope extended to the entire filesystem.

The constraints required filtering by:

- User ownership  
- Group ownership  
- Exact file size  

Manual searching was not practical. A metadata-driven approach was required.

---

## Key Concept

The `find` command supports filtering by filesystem metadata, including:

- `-user` (file owner)
- `-group` (group ownership)
- `-size` (exact size)
- `-type` (file type)

When searching from the root directory, permission errors are expected and must be handled appropriately.

---

## Solution

Search from the root directory and suppress permission errors:

```bash
find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null
```

Breakdown:

- `/` — search entire filesystem  
- `-type f` — regular files only  
- `-user bandit7` — owned by bandit7  
- `-group bandit6` — group ownership bandit6  
- `-size 33c` — exactly 33 bytes  
- `2>/dev/null` — suppress permission denied messages  

After locating the file:

```bash
cat /path/to/file
```

---

## Explanation

- File ownership and size are stored as filesystem metadata.
- `find` evaluates metadata without requiring file read access.
- Redirecting stderr (`2>`) keeps output focused by discarding permission errors.
- Combining predicates significantly reduces search space.

This approach avoids unnecessary noise while maintaining precision.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Metadata is often more useful than filenames.
- Global searches require handling permission-related output.
- Standard streams (stdin, stdout, stderr) operate independently.
- Precision in filtering prevents overwhelming results.

---

## Practical Relevance

This pattern applies directly to:

- Auditing file ownership in production environments  
- Security investigations  
- Compliance verification  
- Troubleshooting permission-related issues  
- Large-scale filesystem analysis  

This level reinforced systematic metadata querying over exploratory browsing.
