# Bandit Level 9 → Level 10

## Objective

Retrieve the password stored in `data.txt`.  
The password appears within one of the few human-readable strings and is preceded by multiple `=` characters.

---

## Problem

Viewing the file directly:

```bash
cat data.txt
```

produced unreadable output.

This indicated that the file contained binary data rather than plain text.

The task required extracting readable content embedded within binary data.

---

## Key Concept

Binary files may contain printable character sequences.

The `strings` command extracts readable strings from binary content.  
However, extraction alone is insufficient — the output must be filtered based on known patterns.

---

## Solution

Extract printable strings:

```bash
strings data.txt
```

Filter for lines containing multiple `=` characters:

```bash
strings data.txt | grep "===="
```

---

## Explanation

- `strings` scans binary data for printable character sequences.
- `grep` filters those sequences based on a pattern.
- The pipe (`|`) connects extraction to filtering in a single processing chain.

The password was identifiable because it matched the structural hint provided.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Binary files require appropriate inspection tools.
- Extraction and filtering are often layered.
- Tool selection depends on content type, not filename.
- Pattern-based filtering improves precision.

---

## Practical Relevance

This pattern applies directly to:

- Inspecting compiled binaries  
- Investigating unknown file formats  
- Security analysis and incident response  
- Reverse engineering tasks  
- Debugging corrupted or mixed-format files  

This level reinforced structured binary inspection and tool chaining in Unix environments.
