# Bandit Level 8 → Level 9

## Objective

Retrieve the password stored in `data.txt`.  
The correct password is the only line that appears exactly once.

---

## Problem

An initial attempt:

```bash
uniq -u data.txt
```

did not produce the expected result.

This occurs because `uniq` only compares adjacent lines.  
It does not detect duplicates that are separated within the file.

---

## Key Concept

The `uniq` command operates on consecutive duplicate lines.

If identical lines are not adjacent, `uniq` will treat them as distinct entries.

Therefore, the input must be sorted before deduplication.

---

## Solution

Sort the file before applying `uniq`:

```bash
sort data.txt | uniq -u
```

---

## Explanation

- `sort` groups identical lines together.
- `uniq -u` prints only lines that appear exactly once.
- The pipe (`|`) passes the output of `sort` directly to `uniq`.

This creates a simple data-processing pipeline.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Some tools require specific input conditions.
- `uniq` operates on adjacent comparisons, not global search.
- Sorting is often a prerequisite for deduplication.
- Pipelines enable modular stream processing.

---

## Practical Relevance

This pattern applies directly to:

- Log deduplication  
- Data preprocessing  
- Cleaning structured datasets  
- Automation scripts that process text streams  

This level reinforced stream normalization and command composition as core Unix principles.
