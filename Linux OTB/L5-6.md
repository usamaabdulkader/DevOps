# Bandit Level 5 → Level 6

## Objective

Retrieve the password stored in a file under the `inhere` directory with the following properties:

- Human-readable  
- Exactly 1033 bytes  
- Not executable  

---

## Problem

The `inhere` directory contained multiple subdirectories and numerous files.  
Manual inspection would be inefficient and unreliable.

The challenge required filtering files based on multiple attributes:

- File type  
- Exact size  
- Executability  
- Nested directory structure  

This level introduced searching by metadata rather than by filename.

---

## Key Concept

The `find` command enables filtering based on filesystem attributes, including:

- Type  
- Size  
- Permissions  
- Ownership  
- Depth  

Instead of iterating manually, constraints can be expressed declaratively.

---

## Solution

Search for files matching all required conditions:

```bash
find inhere -type f -size 1033c ! -executable
```

Breakdown:

- `inhere` — starting directory  
- `-type f` — regular files only  
- `-size 1033c` — exactly 1033 bytes  
- `! -executable` — exclude executable files  

After identifying the matching file:

```bash
cat path/to/file
```

---

## Explanation

- `find` evaluates file metadata directly from the filesystem.
- `-size 1033c` ensures byte-accurate matching.
- Logical predicates can be combined to narrow results precisely.
- This eliminates trial-and-error inspection.

Note: `find -size` operates on actual byte size, which may differ from how disk usage is displayed by other tools.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Filesystem queries should be expressed programmatically.
- Combining predicates improves precision and efficiency.
- Metadata-based filtering is more reliable than manual inspection.
- Exact byte-level matching can be critical.

---

## Practical Relevance

This pattern applies directly to:

- Searching large log directories  
- Filtering build artifacts  
- Security auditing and forensic analysis  
- Automating system inspection tasks  

This level reinforced structured filesystem querying over manual exploration.
