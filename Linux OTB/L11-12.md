# Bandit Level 11 → Level 12

## Objective

Retrieve the password stored in `data.txt`.  
All alphabetic characters (a–z, A–Z) have been rotated by 13 positions (ROT13).

---

## Problem

The file contained readable characters, but the text was unintelligible.  
The challenge description indicated a rotation cipher.

The task was to apply a ROT13 transformation using available command-line tools.

---

## Key Concept

The `tr` command performs character-by-character translation:

```
tr SET1 SET2
```

Each character in `SET1` is mapped to the corresponding character in `SET2`.

ROT13 divides the alphabet into two halves:

- A–M ↔ N–Z  
- a–m ↔ n–z  

The mapping must be explicitly defined.

---

## Solution

Apply the transformation using `tr`:

```bash
tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' < data.txt
```

---

## Explanation

- The English alphabet contains 26 letters.
- Rotating by 13 shifts each letter halfway across the alphabet.
- `A-Z` maps to `N-ZA-M`
- `a-z` maps to `n-za-m`
- `tr` applies the positional mapping directly to the input stream.

ROT13 is symmetric: applying it twice restores the original text.

---

## Key Takeaways

- `tr` performs deterministic positional character mapping.
- Man pages describe primitives, not predefined solutions.
- Conceptual rules must often be translated into explicit syntax.
- Character-level transformations operate independently of word structure.

---

## Practical Relevance

Character transformations appear in:

- Log obfuscation  
- Basic cryptographic demonstrations  
- Data sanitation pipelines  
- Text preprocessing in automation workflows  

This level reinforced deriving solutions from documented tool capabilities rather than relying on built-in shortcuts.
