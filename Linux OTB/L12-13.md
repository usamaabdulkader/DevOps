# Bandit Level 12 → Level 13

## Objective

Retrieve the password stored in `data.txt`.

The file is a hexdump of a repeatedly compressed file.

---

## Problem

Opening `data.txt` displayed readable ASCII text.  
However, the description indicated it was a hexdump of compressed data.

This implied:

- The content represented binary data in text form.
- The binary needed to be reconstructed before decompression.
- Multiple compression layers were likely involved.

This required a structured, iterative workflow rather than a single command.

---

## Step 1: Reconstruct Binary from Hexdump

Convert the hexdump back into binary:

```bash
xxd -r data.txt > data.bin
```

Inspect the reconstructed file:

```bash
file data.bin
```

The output identified the compression format (e.g., gzip).

---

## Step 2: Iterative Decompression

From this point onward, the process became iterative:

1. Identify file type using `file`
2. Rename if necessary to match expected extension
3. Decompress using the appropriate tool
4. Reinspect the resulting file
5. Repeat until plain text is reached

Example:

```bash
mv data.bin data.gz
gunzip data.gz
```

Then:

```bash
file data
```

Depending on the output:

- `gzip compressed data` → `gunzip`
- `bzip2 compressed data` → `bunzip2`
- `POSIX tar archive` → `tar -xf`
- Other formats → select appropriate tool

This loop continued until the final output was readable text.

---

## Explanation

- `xxd -r` reverses a hexdump into its original binary form.
- `file` determines type based on content (magic numbers), not extension.
- Many decompression tools expect conventional filename extensions.
- Renaming does not alter content; it enables correct tool behavior.

The workflow was evidence-driven, not trial-and-error.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Text can represent binary data (hexdump format).
- Compression may be layered multiple times.
- File extensions are conventions; content determines format.
- Diagnostic tools should guide each step.
- Iterative inspection is common in real-world debugging.

---

## Practical Relevance

This approach applies directly to:

- Investigating unknown production artifacts  
- Debugging corrupted or layered archives  
- Security and forensic analysis  
- Handling nested container or archive formats  
- Reverse engineering structured data bundles  

This level marked a transition from executing commands to orchestrating tools based on systematic inspection.
