# Bandit Level 10 → Level 11

## Objective

Retrieve the password stored in `data.txt`.  
The file contains Base64-encoded data.

---

## Problem

Viewing the file:

```bash
cat data.txt
```

displayed readable characters, but the content was not meaningful text.

The structure — long strings containing uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, `+`, `/`, and `=` — indicated Base64 encoding rather than plain text or compression.

---

## Key Concept

Base64 is an encoding scheme that converts binary data into ASCII text.

Key distinctions:

- Encoding changes representation.
- Compression reduces size.
- Encoded files remain text-based.
- Compressed files are typically binary.

Encoded data must be decoded before it becomes meaningful.

---

## Solution

Decode the file:

```bash
base64 -d data.txt
```

---

## Explanation

- `base64 -d` decodes Base64-encoded input.
- The file content matched Base64 character patterns.
- No decompression was required because the data was encoded, not compressed.

This demonstrates the importance of identifying data format before selecting a tool.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Encoded data may appear readable but lack semantic meaning.
- Encoding and compression serve different purposes.
- Tool selection should follow format identification.
- Content structure often provides clues about representation.

---

## Practical Relevance

Recognizing Base64 encoding is common when working with:

- API payloads  
- Cloud configuration files  
- Kubernetes secrets  
- Email attachments  
- Security tokens  

Understanding data representation is essential for debugging and infrastructure operations.
