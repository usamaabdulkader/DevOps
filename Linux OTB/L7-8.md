# Bandit Level 7 → Level 8

## Objective

Retrieve the password stored in the file `data.txt` next to the word "millionth".

---

## Problem

The file `data.txt` contained a large number of lines.  
Manually scanning the file was inefficient.

The task required locating a specific pattern:

- A line containing the word "millionth"
- The password appearing on the same line

This shifted the focus from filesystem operations to text filtering.

---

## Key Concept

The `grep` command searches input for lines matching a given pattern.

Rather than reading the entire file, targeted filtering can isolate relevant data.

---

## Solution

Search for lines containing the word:

```bash
grep millionth data.txt
```

For exact word matching:

```bash
grep -w millionth data.txt
```

---

## Explanation

- `grep` scans input line by line.
- Only lines matching the specified pattern are returned.
- The `-w` flag ensures full-word matches, preventing partial matches.
- This eliminates unnecessary manual inspection.

This demonstrates efficient text filtering using command-line tools.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Text processing is central to Unix-based workflows.
- Pattern matching is more efficient than manual inspection.
- `grep` is foundational for log analysis and data extraction.
- Precision flags (e.g., `-w`) improve reliability.

---

## Practical Relevance

This pattern applies directly to:

- Log analysis  
- Searching configuration files  
- Extracting values in automation scripts  
- Monitoring and troubleshooting systems  

This level reinforced structured text filtering as a core Linux skill.
