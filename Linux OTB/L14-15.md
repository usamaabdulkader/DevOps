# Bandit Level 14 → Level 15

## Objective

Retrieve the next password by submitting the current level's password to port `30000` on `localhost`.

---

## Problem

The challenge required:

- Connecting to `localhost`
- Communicating over TCP port `30000`
- Sending the current password
- Receiving a response

The key question was whether to act as a server or as a client.

The phrase “submit the password to port 30000” implies that a service is already listening. Therefore, we must act as a client.

Using `-l` (listen mode) would incorrectly attempt to create a server.

---

## Key Concepts

- TCP client/server model  
- Difference between listen mode and connect mode  
- Standard input (stdin) and standard output (stdout)  
- Stream-based socket communication  

---

## Solution

Connect as a TCP client:

```bash
nc localhost 30000
```

After connecting:

- Paste the current password  
- Press Enter  
- Read the returned password  

Non-interactive method:

```bash
echo "<current_password>" | nc localhost 30000
```

---

## Explanation

- `nc` (netcat) opens a raw TCP connection.
- Data sent to stdin is forwarded directly to the socket.
- Server responses are printed to stdout.
- No special "submit" flag exists — the shell handles input redirection and piping.

The solution relies on understanding stream forwarding, not memorizing command options.

---

## Alternative Tools

Other TCP clients can also communicate with the service:

```bash
telnet localhost 30000
```

```bash
openssl s_client -connect localhost:30000
```

Because the service expects plain text over TCP, any tool capable of opening a raw TCP connection can be used.

---

## Key Takeaways

- `-l` is used only when acting as a server.
- Connecting to an existing service requires no special submission flag.
- `nc` forwards stdin directly to a TCP socket.
- Shell redirection (`|`, `<`) manages input streams.
- Networking tools operate on byte streams unless higher-level protocols are involved.

---

## Practical Relevance

This model applies directly to:

- Debugging microservices  
- Testing open ports  
- Verifying service availability  
- Incident response and troubleshooting  
- Low-level network diagnostics  

Understanding raw TCP communication is foundational for DevOps, infrastructure engineering, and security analysis.
