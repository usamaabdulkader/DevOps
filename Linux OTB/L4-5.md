# Bandit Level 4 → Level 5

## Objective

Retrieve the password stored in the only human-readable file within the `inhere` directory.

---

## Problem

The `inhere` directory contained multiple files with non-descriptive filenames.  
Opening them directly using `cat` produced unreadable output in most cases.

This indicated that most files were likely binary rather than plain text.

The challenge was to identify the single human-readable file without manually inspecting each one.

---

## Key Concept

Not all files are text files.

Linux systems store data in multiple formats:

- Plain text (human-readable)
- Binary data (compiled or structured formats)
- Encoded data

File type should be verified before attempting to interpret content.

---

## Solution

Use the `file` command to determine the type of each file:

```bash
file *
```

This analyzes file contents and reports their format.

After identifying the file classified as ASCII text (or human-readable), display its contents:

```bash
cat filename
```

---

## Explanation

- `file` determines type based on content patterns, not filenames.
- Binary files contain non-printable byte sequences.
- Text files contain readable character data.

Using `file` avoids unnecessary manual inspection and prevents misinterpretation of binary output.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Filenames are not reliable indicators of file type.
- Binary output appearing as unreadable text is expected behavior.
- Diagnostic tools should be used before interacting with unknown data.
- Inspection should precede interpretation.

---

## Practical Relevance

Understanding file types is essential when:

- Investigating deployment artifacts
- Handling logs and executables
- Working with compressed or encoded data
- Performing security analysis on unknown files

This level introduced structured inspection using system tools rather than trial-and-error exploration.
