# Bandit Level 1 → Level 2

## Objective

Retrieve the password stored in a file named `-`.

---

## Problem

Attempting to read the file using:

```bash
cat -
```

did not return the file contents. Instead, the command waited for input.

This behavior occurs because in Unix systems, `-` is commonly interpreted as standard input (stdin), not a literal filename.

---

## Solution

To ensure the hyphen is treated as a filename, it must be referenced explicitly.

```bash
cat ./-
```

or

```bash
cat -- -
```

---

## Explanation

- `./-` explicitly identifies `-` as a file in the current directory.
- `--` marks the end of command options, forcing the following argument to be treated as a filename rather than a flag or special token.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Command-line tools follow strict parsing rules.
- Special characters in filenames can alter command behavior.
- Understanding how arguments are interpreted is critical when writing reliable shell commands and scripts.

---

## Practical Relevance

This scenario highlights the importance of argument parsing awareness when developing automation scripts or working in environments where file naming cannot be controlled.
