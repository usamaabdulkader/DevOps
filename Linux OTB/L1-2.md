# Bandit Level 1 → 2

## Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in a file called `-` located in the home directory.

---

## Commands Used

- `ls`
- `cat`
- `pwd`

---

## The Problem

The filename is `-`.

In Linux, `-` is often interpreted as **standard input (stdin)** by commands like `cat`.

So running:

```bash
cat -
```

does not read the file — it waits for input from the keyboard.

---

## Solution Methods

###  Method 1 — Use Relative Path

```bash
cat ./-
```

---

### Method 2 — Use Absolute Path

```bash
cat /home/bandit1/-
```

---

### Output

```
<level-2-password>
```

---

### Login to Next Level

```bash
ssh bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

## What I Learned

- Special characters in filenames can interfere with commands
- `-` is commonly used to represent standard input
- Prefixing with `./` forces Linux to treat it as a file
- Understanding stdin/stdout is essential in Linux systems
