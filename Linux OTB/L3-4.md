# Bandit Level 3 → Level 4

## Objective

Retrieve the password stored in a hidden file inside the `inhere` directory.

---

## Problem

After navigating to the directory and running:

```bash
ls
```

no files were displayed.

Given that the challenge specified a file existed in this directory, the issue was not file absence but file visibility.

---

## Key Concept

In Unix-based systems:

- Files beginning with `.` are hidden by default.
- The standard `ls` command does not display hidden files.
- Hidden files are commonly used for configuration and system-level data.

Hidden status affects visibility, not access permissions.

---

## Solution

List all files, including hidden ones:

```bash
ls -a
```

After identifying the hidden file, display its contents:

```bash
cat .hidden_filename
```

(The actual filename varies per session.)

---

## Explanation

- The `-a` flag instructs `ls` to show all directory entries.
- Hidden files are excluded from default output as a usability convention.
- There is no restriction on reading hidden files if permissions allow access.

The issue was not access control, but default filtering behavior.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Hidden files are a naming convention, not a security feature.
- Default command behavior may filter output.
- When expected results are missing, review how tools handle visibility.

---

## Practical Relevance

Understanding hidden files is essential when:

- Managing user configuration (`.bashrc`, `.profile`, `.ssh`)
- Troubleshooting environment inconsistencies
- Inspecting application configuration in Linux systems
- Working with repositories (`.git` directories)

This level reinforced systematic inspection and awareness of default command behavior.
