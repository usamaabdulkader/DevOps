# Bandit Level 13 → Level 14

## Objective

The password for the next level is stored in `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14` and is readable only by user `bandit14`.

A private SSH key (`sshkey.private`) is provided. The task is to authenticate as `bandit14` using key-based authentication.

---

## Problem

After obtaining the private key, several issues needed to be resolved:

- How to use the key with SSH
- Where the SSH command should be executed
- Why connections from within the Bandit server were blocked
- Why SSH rejected the key due to permissions

This level required understanding authentication context rather than just command syntax.

---

## Key Concepts

- SSH key-based authentication
- Client vs server execution context
- Private key permission requirements
- Secure default behavior in SSH

---

## Solution

Use the private key with the `-i` flag:

```bash
ssh -i ./sshkey.private bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

---

## Execution Context

An early mistake was attempting to SSH into the Bandit server from within an existing Bandit session.

This failed because:

- The server blocks SSH connections originating from itself.
- Authentication context depends on where the SSH client runs.

The command must be executed from the local machine, not from inside the remote session.

---

## Private Key Permissions

SSH refused to use the key due to overly permissive file permissions:

```
WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!
```

Correct permissions:

```bash
chmod 600 sshkey.private
```

This restricts access to the file owner only.

SSH enforces strict private key protection as a security measure.

---

## Explanation

- `-i` specifies the identity file used for authentication.
- SSH validates private key permissions before use.
- Authentication is identity-based, not password-based.
- Execution context determines whether a connection is permitted.

---

## Key Takeaways

- SSH key-based authentication is standard in production environments.
- Private keys must be protected with restrictive permissions.
- Client/server roles directly affect connection behavior.
- Authentication failures often stem from environment context, not syntax errors.

---

## Practical Relevance

This workflow applies directly to:

- Accessing cloud virtual machines  
- Deploying applications via SSH  
- CI/CD pipeline authentication  
- Managing secure infrastructure  
- Automating remote system administration  

This level marked the transition from local command usage to secure remote identity management.
