Bandit Level 0 → 1

Level Goal

Log into the Bandit wargame server using SSH.
Host: bandit.labs.overthewire.org
Port: 2220
Username: bandit0
Password: bandit0

Command Used
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

Command Breakdown
ssh username@host -p portnumber
ssh → Secure Shell client
username@host → Specifies the remote user and server
-p 2220 → Connects using a non-standard port
Bandit runs SSH on port 2220 instead of default port 22.

SSH with a Private Key (Later Levels)

Some later levels require key-based authentication:

ssh -i ./sshkey.private bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
-i → Specifies identity (private key file)
Used instead of password authentication

What I Learned

How to connect to a remote server using SSH
How to specify a non-default port
Difference between password-based and key-based authentication
Basic remote access workflow in Linux
