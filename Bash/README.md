# Bash Scripting Projects

This directory contains structured Bash scripting practice organized into two main areas:

- **Assignments** – Focused foundational exercises
- **Bash Battle Arena** – Progressive, level-based scripting challenges

Together, these projects demonstrate practical command-line proficiency and structured skill development in Bash.

---

## 📁 Assignments

A collection of focused scripting exercises covering core concepts such as:

- Arithmetic operations
- File and directory manipulation
- Permission checks
- Backup automation
- Defensive scripting practices

These scripts emphasize clarity, correct syntax, and foundational Linux operations.

## ⚔️ Bash Battle Arena

A progressive, level-based scripting project designed to build skills incrementally.

The Arena begins with basic file operations and gradually advances toward:

- Argument parsing
- File sorting
- Multi-file searching
- Directory monitoring
- Integrated multi-step workflows (Boss Battles)

Each level is implemented as a standalone Bash script.

---

## Skills Demonstrated

Across both sections, this repository demonstrates:

- Bash control structures (loops, conditionals)
- Argument handling
- File system operations
- Command pipelines
- Randomization and automation logic
- Structured problem-solving
- Defensive scripting techniques

---

## Purpose

This repository reflects hands-on practice in Bash scripting and Linux fundamentals relevant to automation, DevOps workflows, and system-level troubleshooting.
