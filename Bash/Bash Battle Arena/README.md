# Bash Battle Arena

Bash Battle Arena is a level-based scripting project designed to progressively strengthen Bash fundamentals through practical challenges.

Each level focuses on a specific concept, with periodic Boss Battles that integrate multiple skills into larger scripting tasks.

Currently includes 10 completed levels demonstrating structured progression from foundational commands to intermediate scripting workflows.

---

## Structure

Each level is implemented as a standalone Bash script:

```
level01.sh
level02.sh
...
level10.sh
```

Every script is self-contained and can be executed independently.

Boss levels (Level 5 and Level 10) combine previously learned concepts into more comprehensive challenges.

## Skill Progression

### Levels 1–4
Core fundamentals:
- Directory and file creation
- Loops
- Conditional statements
- File manipulation

### Level 5 – Boss Battle 1
Combines:
- Directory management
- File creation
- Conditional checks
- File movement

### Levels 6–9
Intermediate scripting:
- Argument parsing
- File sorting
- Multi-file searching
- Directory monitoring and logging

### Level 10 – Boss Battle 2
Advanced integration:
- Randomized file generation
- Nested loops
- Size-based sorting
- Pattern detection
- Conditional file archiving

## Learning Objectives

This project reinforces:

- Bash control structures
- Argument handling
- File system operations
- Command pipelines
- Defensive scripting practices
- Structured problem-solving

The focus is on clarity, maintainability, and progressive skill development rather than one-liner shortcuts.

## How to Run

Make a script executable:

```bash
chmod +x level01.sh
```

Run the script:

```bash
./level01.sh
```

Each level can be executed independently.
